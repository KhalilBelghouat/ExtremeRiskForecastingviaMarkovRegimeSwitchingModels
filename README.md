# Extreme Risk Forecasting via Markov Regime-Switching Models: Evidence from the Moroccan All Shares Index

This repository includes the code used in one of the master's projects "Extreme Risk Forecasting via Markov Regime-Switching Models: Evidence from the Moroccan All Shares Index" by Khalil Belghouat.

In this project, a Markov regime-switching extreme value theory approach is followed in order to model and forecast the tail risk of the Moroccan All Shares Index.

## Prerequisites

The ```R``` programming language, version 4.2.0, and its statistical and machine learning libraries were used to build all applied models. The ```R``` script _packages.R_ in the _packages_ folder installs and loads all necessary ```R``` packages. 

All operations, from data preprocessing to model estimation, were carried out on the Google Colaboratory platform.
