# Extreme Risk Forecasting via Markov Regime-Switching Models: Evidence from the Moroccan All Shares Index

This repository includes the code used in one of the master's projects "Extreme Risk Forecasting via Markov Regime-Switching Models: Evidence from the Moroccan All Shares Index" by Khalil Belghouat.

In this project, a Markov regime-switching extreme value theory approach is followed in order to model and forecast the tail risk of the Moroccan All Shares Index.
